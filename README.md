# Symptom Tracker Server


## Local dev setup

If using user `dunder-mifflin`:

```bash
mv example.env .env
createdb -U dunder-mifflin symptom-tracker
createdb -U dunder-mifflin symptom-tracker-test
```

If your `dunder-mifflin` user has a password be sure to set it in `.env` for all appropriate fields. Or if using a different user, update appropriately.

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
env MIGRATION_DB_NAME=symptom-tracker-test npm run migrate
```
Seed your database with the /seeds/seed.tables.sql file

And `npm test` should work at this point


## Configuring Postgres

For tests involving time to run properly, configure your Postgres database to run in the UTC timezone.

1. Locate the `postgresql.conf` file for your Postgres installation.
   1. E.g. for an OS X, Homebrew install: `/usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`
   2. E.g. on Windows, _maybe_: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11.2\data\postgresql.conf`
   3. E.g  on Ubuntu 18.04 probably: '/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf'
2. Find the `timezone` line and set it to `UTC`:

```conf
# - Locale and Formatting -

datestyle = 'iso, mdy'
#intervalstyle = 'postgres'
timezone = 'UTC'
#timezone_abbreviations = 'Default'     # Select the set of available time zone
```

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`



## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.
